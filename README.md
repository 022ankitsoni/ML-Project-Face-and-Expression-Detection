# Real Time Face Detection with AI

This project demonstrates how to set up real-time face detection using AI in a web application. By using the Face API JS library built on Tensor Flow, we are able to quickly and accurately detect faces and draw facial landmarks in real-time, even while streaming video from a webcam.
